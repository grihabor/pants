    title: Delete rules (advanced)

Delete builtin rules and define your own to override behavior.

---

Sometimes you might want to change the behavior of some existing backend in a way that is not supported by the backend. `DeleteRule` allows you to remove a single rule from the backend, then you can implement your own version of the same rule.

For example, you might want to change the behavior of the `list` goal, here is how you do it:


```python title="pants-plugins/custom_list/register.py"
from pants.backend.project_info.list_targets import List, ListSubsystem
from pants.backend.project_info.list_targets import list_targets as original_rule
from pants.engine.addresses import Addresses
from pants.engine.console import Console
from pants.engine.rules import DeleteRule, collect_rules, goal_rule


@goal_rule
async def list_targets(addresses: Addresses, list_subsystem: ListSubsystem, console: Console) -> List:
    with list_subsystem.line_oriented(console) as print_stdout:
        print_stdout("ha cool")
    return List(exit_code=0)


def target_types():
    return []


def rules():
    return (
        *collect_rules(),
        DeleteRule.create(original_rule),
    )
```

```python title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
...
backend_packages = [
    ...
    "custom_list",
]
```

```python title="pants-plugins/custom_list/__init__.py"
```
